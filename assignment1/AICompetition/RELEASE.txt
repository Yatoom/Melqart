Version 0.2 - 19/02/2014

IMPORTANT: 
           (0) The project 2ID90-Group-NN did not change.
           (1) Only project AICompetition changed; normally, you should not have edited that project.
               So, you can safely replace your current version with this version.
           (2) when using this new version, you (again) have to fill in the Run parameters 
               in the properties of the AICompetition project.  See assignment description 
               or working older version of the project.

Changelog:

Several fixes:
* Now a copy of the DraughtsState is given to Player.getMove; 
  so, no matter how the method getMove manipulates this draughts state, the GUI remains unaffected.
  This fixes a problem where an AIException prevents the undoMove methods in alphabeta to restore the DraughtsState.

* The move list now shows the actually played moves in the game.

* Exception generated by stop button should be fixed.

* Class DraughtsState now has a clone method, for those who think that they can benefit from it.

* GUI has been cleaned.


New features:

* Moves on the board are now animated to improve the visualization of the game play.

* It is now possible to play back a game, by manipulating the moves in the move list: 
  Use arrow keys, or click on the moves. The shown state on the board is the state after
  the highlighted move has been played

* The thinking time of the computer player may be set; default time 2 seconds.

* An option panel has been added; it comes with the following features:
  * editable game state: 
	left clicking for a normal piece
        right clicking for a king
    This is only available when there is no game going on.

  * swapping of starting player: if you want the other player to start in a given board state
    you may press "swap starting player".

  * starting in begin state
    option to start with normal board state or continue with the current board state.

* The source code of AICompetition contains two places where you can tune the timings
  of the moves, currently these settings are not available via the GUI:
     * In DraughtsGUI the variable ANIMATION_TIME gives the time needed for animating the move. Default 400 milliseconds.
     * In CompetitionGUI the variable MIN_DELAY is the minimum time needed to perform a move. Default: 1500 milliseconds.
  Note, normally you do not need to tune this at all.
